                    <h2>Traveling is easier than you think.</h2>
                    <p>We believe that traveling around the world shouldn’t be hard: it’s actually something everyone should be able to
                        do at least once in their lives. Whether you choose to spend a few years or just a couple months traveling this
                        beautiful planet, it’s important to see what’s out there. It’s up to you to make the dream come true and take
                        the first step. Launch TripPlanner to piece together and price your ideal route. Not sure where to start?  You
                        can always call one of our travel consultants and get some complimentary advice!</p>
                    
                    <h2>Travel opens your eyes.</h2>
                    <p>If you’re open and willing, travel will make you an incredibly more well-rounded human being. And that’s really
                        the goal, isn’t it? If you don’t know where to start, check out our Around the World planning guide.</p>
                    
                    <h2>Traveling helps you learn who you are.</h2>
                    <p>All the challenges and opportunities travel lays at your feet help you discover who you are in a way that’s
                        only possible on the road.</p>
                    
                    <h2>Travel creates meaningful relationships</h2>
                    <p>People you meet while on the road become some of the most valued names on your contact list. They become places
                        on the map to visit later on. These folks give you a glimpse outside your hometown circle of friends, and force
                        you to take in new and refreshing perspectives, and ultimately realize that everyone is the same.</p>

       

                    <h2 class="section-heading">Best Place to travel</h2>

                    <p>This year’s list ranges from the Andaman Islands, off India (which impressed even the most discerning ocean-lover,
                        Jacques Cousteau), to an unspoiled stretch of the Caribbean, and nine other beach destinations with sun, sand, and
                        beautiful views. For food lovers, we’ve got everything from Ghent, Belgium (where a group of young chefs is leading
                        the culinary revolution and plans for a massive food hall are under way), to the canal town of Aarhus, Denmark, which
                        is stepping out of Copenhagen’s shadow with three Michelin-starred restaurants of its own.</p>
                    
                    <p>Closer to home, once-overlooked spots have proven themselves worthy of another glance. The bike-friendly town of Richmond,
                        Virginia, has standout architecture, a burgeoning art and food scene, and a brand-new design hotel. Detroit’s renewal
                        has been on our radar for a while, and with signs of life springing up in its abandoned buildings—including a hotel that
                        set up shop in a historic fire-department headquarters—it’s finally earned a much-deserved spot on this list. And in San Antonio
                        , the Roman and Williams–designed Hotel Emma, in a former brewhouse, sits at the heart of the restaurant- and shopping-packed
                        Pearl district.</p>

                    <span class="caption text-muted">To go places and do things that have never been done before – that’s what living is all about.</span>

                    <p>In the geopolitical sphere, the recently signed nuclear deal between Iran and the UN security council has opened up opportunities
                        for Americans to more readily visit the cosmopolitan capital of Tehran and the mosques of Kashan. And while Cuba  was on last year’s
                        list, a spate of new cruises that dock in Havana—all thanks to eased travel restrictions for Americans—mean the destination is
                        continuing to blossom. Cruise ships are also heading to Batumi, in Georgia, with its gorgeous botanical garden. It’s a Black Sea
                        port that’s gaining attention from the big cruise brands given the safety concerns in Ukraine.</p>

                    <p>Whether you’re looking for a weekend getaway close to home, a farther-flung bucket-list trip—or even a multi-stop tour that
                        combines, say, the art- and design-filled Taipei, the classic Chinese retreat of Hangzhou, and the hip surf community of Canggu,
                        Bali—consider the 50 incredible destinations on this list a road map for your planning and inspiration in 2016.</p>
